					<h1>Childhood</h1>
					<p>
						As a child i had several pets. My first pet was a pet hamster.<br>
						His name was lillen because he was tiny. My second pet was a turtle. His name shall not be spoken here.
						At some point my sister got a parrot which was green.<br>
						Surprisingly there are such parrots living in london as well. Who would have guessed, right?
						Anyhow, i had a pretty ordinary childhood with ups and downs like most other children.<br>
						I am, however, thankful for the things that happened since they led me to were i am today.
