					<h1>Current Occupation</h1>
					<p>
						As of now i am a student at DSV in Stockholm Kista. I studie computer science and programming.<br>
						My hobbies are spending time with friends and exercise.

					<h1>Programming competence</h1>
					<p>
						As aformention I program. During my studies I have gotten to know several programming languages and paradigmed.<br>
						I do not find my competence to be equal in all of these programming languages, however, I thought is usefull to show you what languages i am femiliar with and how well i write in them. 
					</p>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Java</b></li>
						<li><b>Flutter</b></li>
						<li><b>C++</b></li>
						<li><b>Python</b></li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						To no surprise I am most compitent with <mark><b>Java</b></mark>. The reason I say that this should come to no surprise is the fact that this is the defacto programming language at most universities.<br>
						The next runner up if Flutter, which is a programming language we used during a course to build an android application.<br>
						Alhough, we only used this language during one course I got to know if quite well due to the time spend fidgeting around with it in our app.<br>
						It was a fabuless experience building the app and I really enjoyed building something bigger in a larger group.<br>
						During that time we also worked with <mark><b>Scrum</b></mark> and <mark><b>Agile development</b></mark>. This promted us to take on different roles and responsibilities.<br>
						My role during this project was scrum master and in a more general way, manager. I was overlooking alot of the precessies during the building of our app as well as coding alot of the frontend myself.<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						For those of you reading this who are uninitiated I would like to explain to you the different roles that are in scrum which our group was devided into so that you would have a better idee of what each groupmember learned depending on their role. 	
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt><b>Scrum Master</b></dt>
						<dd>Leads the team in working effectively according to scrum values</dd>
						
						<dt><b>Product Owner</b></dt>
						<dd>Makes sure the scrum team aligns with the product goals</dd>

						<dt><b>Development Team</b></dt>		
						<dd>Proffesionals responsable for the hands-on work</dd>
					</dl>
					
					<p>
						Of course, there was no product owner for our project since it was a university assignment, however, I guess that one could argue our teachers as being our product owners or the closest thing to it.<br>
						Anyhow, we learned alot during these courses and got to feel for ourselves what it meant to build something from scratch on our own. <br>
						To me this was some of the most fullfilling times spent during my studies and something to look back on fondly.
