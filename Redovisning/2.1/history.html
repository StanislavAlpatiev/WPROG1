					<h2>Childhood</h2>
					<p>
						As a child i had several pets. My first pet was a pet hamster.<br>
						His name was lillen because he was tiny. My second pet was a turtle. His name shall not be spoken here.
						At some point my sister got a parrot which was green.<br>
						Surprisingly there are such parrots living in london as well. Who would have guessed, right?
						Anyhow, i had a pretty ordinary childhood with ups and downs like most other children.<br>
						I am, however, thankful for the things that happened since they led me to were i am today.

					<h2>Early Travels</h2>
					
					<h1>Germany 2007</h1>
					<p>
						During the year 2007 me and my family traveled to Germany to visit some friends of ours. During this trip we visited many places.<br>
						The most noticible was a waterfall bordaring Germany and Switzerland. The name of the waterfall is the Rhine waterfall.<br>
						Its very beatifull especially during the winter, which was the time we visited it. <br> The falls were not frozen during that time, instead the waters were happily playing on the rocks.
